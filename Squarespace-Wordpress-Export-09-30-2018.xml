      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 class="text-align-center">Overview &amp; Background</h1><p>The Sausalito Marin City School District serves approximately 500 students and is comprised of two schools: a public K-8 school, Bayside Martin Luther King, Jr. Academy and a public K-8 charter, Willow Creek Academy. In the spring of 2016, following the release of a report by a state management assistance agency, the Marin County Office of Education hired a consultant to examine the feasibility of consolidating the Sausalito Marin City School District with the Mill Valley School District. At the same time, the Sausalito Marin City School Board has formed an ad hoc committee to explore restructuring our district. While it is unclear how the district will proceed, the goal of the Town Halls is to help the broader community better understand the opportunities and challenges facing our district.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Join the discussion!</h2>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 03:05:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <h2>1. How many students are enrolled in our district and which schools do they attend?</h2>
            <p>We currently have 536 students enrolled in our district. They attend one of two schools: Bayside Martin Luther King Jr.  Academy, a traditional K-8 public school located at the Phillips Avenue campus in Marin City which serves 127 students, and Willow Creek Academy a  K-8 public charter school located at the campus on Nevada Street in Sausalito which serves 409 students. <br><a href="http://www.baysidemlk.org/" style="color:#e24612">Bayside Martin Luther King Jr. Academy</a><br><a href=" https://www.willowcreekacademy.org/" style="color:#e24612"> Willow Creek Academy</a></p>
            
            <h2>2. How has enrollment in our district changed over time? </h2>
            <p>Enrollment in our district has increased significantly in the past ten years. Total districtwide public school enrollment (including enrollment to the district's charter school, Willow Creek Academy) has grown from 265 students in the 2006-2007 school year to 558 students in the 2016-2017 school year. At the same time, because we are a basic aid district (see below), property tax revenues allocated to the school district have not increased at the same rate. This has resulted in a decrease in tax spending per student. The chart below shows districtwide enrollment by property tax revenue over time. While property tax revenue is not the only source of public revenue for the district, it is the primary source. <br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GP1-2YX2DRRdAJp6tvfmP6CMF9iv0veJcVcntXQnfwY/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>

            <h2>3. What is a charter school? </h2>
            <p>A charter school in California is a public school which is funded by local and state taxes but is created as a separate entity often with its own board. Charter schools are sometimes referred to as 
'dependent' or 'independent.' So-called 'dependent' or semi-autonomous, charters are operated by school districts and have fewer freedoms than charter schools do. 'Independent' charters are run by sperate entities, usually non-profit organizations. Local school boards have limited control over these charter schools other than the authorization process. While not a legal distinction, Willow Creek Academy would be considered an 'independent' charter. It's charter is authorized by the Sausalito Marin City School District, which provides oversight of the school. <br><a href="http://www.ed-data.org/article/Charter-Schools-in-California" style="color:#e24612">Charter Schools in California</a><br><a href=" https://edsource.org/2017/10-things-to-know-about-charter-schools/583984" style="color:#e24612"> Know About Charter Schools</a></p>
            
            <h2>4. What are the demographics of our district as a whole? What are the demographics within each school? </h2>
            <p>Demgraphic information for both schools is available from the California Department of Education web site. <br><a href="http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/dqcensus/enrethlevels.aspx?agglevel=District&year=2016-17&cds=2165474" style="color:#e24612">District Census Data</a></p>
            
            <h2>5. What is the 'School Accountability Report Card" and where can I find it for my school? </h2>
            <p>Since November 1988, state law has required all public schools receiving state funding to prepare and distribute a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). This report card includes a range of information from class-size to academic data to teacher and staff information. <br><a href="http://www.smcsd.org/files/SARC-BMLK-2015.pdf" style="color:#e24612">Bayside Martin Luther King Jr. Academy SARC</a><br><a href=" https://www.willowcreekacademy.org/cms/lib/CA01001756/Centricity/Domain/55/2015-16%20SARC%20WCA.pdf" style="color:#e24612"> Willow Creek Academy SARC</a></p>
            
            <h2>6. How do our standardized test scores compare to those of students in California  (by school over time)? </h2>
            <p>You can view and compare student scores on the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress over time on the California Department of Education website. <br><a href="https://caaspp.cde.ca.gov/sb2017/CompareReport?ps=true&lstTestYear=2017&lstTestType=B&lstGrade=13&lstGroup=1&lstCds1=00000000000000&lstCds2=21654746118491&lstCds3=21654746024889&lstCompType=graph" style="color:#e24612">CASPP Scores</a></p>
            
            <h2>7. What is meant by student  'growth'? and what do educators think is typical or reasonable to expect in terms of student growth in standardized text scores year to year? </h2>
            <p>Student-growth measures compare the relative change in a student or group of students' performance on a specific test with the performance of all other students on that same test. The scores of all students are used to create an “index of student growth” and to identify a median achievement score that can be used as a point of comparison for all student scores—i.e., some students will show growth that is greater than the median, while others will show growth that is lower than the median. There is no standard for student growth in test scores year-to-year. However, many states that administered the same standardized test with the same questions—known as the Smarter Balanced Assessment—saw no significant change in student growth in 2017 testing as compared to the year before. <br><a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2017/10/05/why-heads-are-still-scratching-over-californias-standardized-test-scores/" style="color:#e24612">Student Growth and Standardized Test Scores</a></p>
            
            <h2>8. How does our district compare to other districts in terms of student equity? </h2>
            <p>The California Department of Education publishes what it calls an 'Equity Report' for each school district in the state. You can view the Equity Report for the Sausalito Marin City school district on the County's website. <br><a href="https://www.caschooldashboard.org/#/Details/21654740000000/3/EquityReport" style="color:#e24612">Bayside Martin Luther King Jr. Academy Equity Report</a></br>

<h2>10. What is FCMAT?</h2>
            <p>FCMAT is the Financial Crisis & Financial Assistance Team.  It is a state organization created to provide fiscal and management advice and technical support to local school districts. FCMAT has been requested to review district operations at least three times, in 1997, 2012 and 2016. <br><a href="http://fcmat.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/12/Fiscal-Oversight-Guide-final-12-2015.pdf" style="color:#e24612">FCMAT Fiscal Oversight Guide</a></p>

            <h2>9. Why is our school district under investigation?</h2>
            <p>In 2016, the County Office of Education asked the State
              Superintendent of Public Instruction to inquire with the State Attorney General's office whether an investigation was warranted based on information contained in recent FCMAT reports (See <a href="http://www.schoolstownhall.org/timeline" target="_blank">timeline</a> for links to recent FCMAT reports and responses to the 2016 report from the District and Willow Creek Academy.) According to, the County Office of Education, their concerns were related to a potential conflict-of-interest regarding the role of parents serving on the district school board. <br><a href="http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20161026/NEWS/161029831" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
          
            <h2>11. What can cause the county or state to take over a school district? </h2>
            <p>Generally speaking a county or state can can take control of a local school district, or Local Education Agency, if it is determined that the district is fiscally insolvent and unable to meet its financial obligations. In this case, the state will issue a loan and maintain control of the district until certain conditions are met. <br><a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/fi/ir/stateemergloans.asp" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
            
            <h2>12. Is it possible the Sausalito Marin City School District could consolidate with another school district? </h2>
            <p>Following the release of the 2016 FCMAT report, the Marin County Office of Education hired a consultant to assess the feasability of consolidating the Sausalito Marin City School District with the Mill Valley School District. In March 2017, the Sausalito Marin City school board voted to support the consolidation study and established the District Structure Committee, an ad-hoc committee, to participate in the study and explore other possible structural changes within the district. <br><a href="http://www.smcsd.org/files/3-28-17-bd%20packet.pdf" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
            
            <h2>13. What is the process for changing or unifying school district boundaries? </h2>
            <p>Changes in school district boundaries are overseen by the County Committee on School District Organization which outlines the process on its website. <br><a href="http://www.marinschools.org/SDO/Pages/SDO-Questions.aspx" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
            
            <h2>14. What is the budget in total for our district and how is it allocated? </h2>
            <p>Total revenues for both schools (LEA's) in our district were approximately $8.7 million for the 2016-17 school year, including in-lieu fund transfers to Willow Creek Academy, considered a separate LEA.  The majority of the revenues are allocated between the two schools based on a state-mandated formula known as the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) . Some revenues are considered 'restricted' such as grant revenues. Those revenues must be allocated in accordance with the applicable restrictions. Any remaining funds are allocated by the district school board. The following represents an approximate breakdown of district-wide spending for the 2016-17 school year.

            <h2>15. When people mention 'the MOU' to what are they referring? </h2>
            <p>The MOU is the Memorandum of Understanding and is the legal contract between the School District and Willow Creek. it currently defines how funds in excess of the state mandated per student funding formula (LCFF) are allocated between the two schools. <br><a href="https://www.willowcreekacademy.org/cms/lib2/CA01001756/Centricity/Domain/21/WCA_MOU_2014-2019%20clean%202-10-15-c.pdf" style="color:#e24612">Memorandum of Understanding</a></p>
            
            <h2>16. What is Local Control Funding Formula? </h2>
            <p>The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) determines how much funding school districts recieve from the state. The formula replaces a system based on historic revenue limits with a per student calculation. The new formula was introduced in the 2013-14 school year, with full implementation of the new funding formula expected to take eight years.  Under the new funding formula, school districts are subject to new rules for transparency and accountability, which include creating—with input from parents and the community—and adopting a Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) that lays out that lays out how the LEA will spend the funds and its goals for improving student outcomes. <br><a href="http://www.ed-data.k12.ca.us/Pages/LCFF.aspx" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
            
            <h2>17. What is a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP)?</h2>
            <p>LCAP is the Local Control and Accountability Plan.  It is a three year plan updated yearly that includes specific goals, actions, and metrics for the school district. School budget allocations are tied to LCAP goals for improving student outcomes according to eight priorities that the legislature set. The priorities include academic achievement, student engagement, parent involvement, and the successful implementation of new academic standards. Districts that fail to meet their goals and improve student outcomes will receive help through a new agency, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. Both the school district and Willow Creek Academy (as a separate LEA) must develop and maintain an LCAP for their respective schools. <br><a href="http://www.smcsd.org/files/SMCSD%20LCAP%202016-19%2006-20-17.pdf" style="color:#e24612">Bayside Martin Luther King Jr. Academy LCAP</a><br><a href=" https://www.willowcreekacademy.org/cms/lib/CA01001756/Centricity/Domain/55/LCAP%20Final%2052517.docx" style="color:#e24612"> Willow Creek Academy LCAP</a></p>
            
            <h2>18. What is the difference between a 'basic aid' district and a 'revenue limit' district? </h2>
            <p>A 'basic aid' district is one whose local property taxes meet or exceed the state-manded per student funding formula, known as LCFF, that determines state funding to local school districts. A 'basic aid' district meets its school funding requirements entirely through property taxes and receive no general purpose state aid. It also retains any excess property taxes within its district. By contrast, in 'revenue limit' districts, also known as 'LCFF' districts (which stands for Locally Control Funded Formula), property taxes do not exceed the state mandated per student funding calculation; therefore the state must make up the difference. Only the state can determine revenue-limit or basic aid status through the revenue limit formula. Although the majority of districts in California are revenue limit, in Marin County, only four districts are revenue-limit districts: Novato, San Rafael elementary only, Ross Valley and Mill Valley are revenue limit. Mill Valley changed from being a 'basic-aid' funded district to being a 'revenue limit' district in 2013-2014 when the state provided per student funding exceeded property tax revenues.The remaining 16 are basic aid and receive their funds directly from their local property taxes. <br><a href="http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_913MWR.pdf" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
            
            <h2>19. What is meant by "basic aid excess / negative excess"?</h2>
            <p>'Basic aid excess' refers to the amount of funding that exceeds the funding the district would have received were it considered a revenue limit district. It is calculated by subtracting the state mandated Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) revenue amounts from the total revenue received by the district. In years when the Sausalito Marin City School District's budgeted expenses (including LCFF mandated expenses as well as special education, facilities costs, capital expenses, district administration and overhead costs per the MOU agreed upon by the district and Willow Creek Academy) exceed total revenue, creating a negative balance, the district has what it refers to as a 'negative basic aid excess'.  Put simply, its basic aid revenues are not sufficient to cover its shared expenses and LCFF entitlements. Whether or not or how expenses such as special education costs and facilities costs should be shared between the traditional school and the charter school impacts the basic aid excess/negative excess calculation and is an issue raised by FCMAT in its reports. <br><a href="http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_913MWR.pdf" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
            
            <h2>20. How is the school tax rate determined? </h2>
            <p>When the ballot measure Proposition 13 was approved by voters in 1978 it capped property taxes limiting the revenues available to counties, cities, and special districts to provide services. Subsequent legislation froze the proportions of property tax allocations among local governments to their pre–Proposition 13 levels. Today, approximately 16% of each tax dollar that residents in the City of Sausalito pay is distributed to the elementary school district according to the Marin County Department of Finance. By comparison, Mill Valley distributes 18% of tax revenues to its elementary school district. Tiburon distributes 17.5% and San Rafael distributes 22% of tax revenues to its elementary school district. Comparable information was not available for the unincorporated community of Marin City. <br><a href="https://www.marincounty.org/depts/df/where-your-tax-dollars-go" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
            
        <h2>21. Beyond property taxes, what are some other ways that tax payers fund schools? </h2>
        <p>School districts in California may also recieve funding through bond measures and parcel taxes if approved by voters. See below.</p>
        
            <h2>22. What is a 'parcel tax'</h2>
            <p>A parcel tax is a tax levied on properties in addition to property tax. Unlike a property tax, it is a flat-tax as opposed to a tax based on the assessed value of the property. In California, it is often used to provide additional funding to schools. The Sausalito Marin City School District does not currently receive parcel tax funding. You can view a list of which districts in Marin County receive funding from parcel taxes on the County of Marin's Office of Education website. <br><a href="http://www.marinschools.org/DistrictParcelTax/Pages/default.aspx" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>
            
            <h2>23. What is a bond and when was the last time the district recieved bond funding?  </h2>
            <p>Bond funds are a debt instrument and are typically used to fund capital improvements such as the construction or renovation of facilities. The last time the district received bond funding was in 2006 after voters approved Measure I in 2004 in the amount of $15.9 million for facility construction and upgrades. In August 2016, after conducting a facilities review and the school board approved putting a $30 million dollar bond measure before voters.  However, the district missed the filing deadline for the November election, and the measure was not included on the ballot. In recent board meetings, the school board has stated it's intention to develop a facilities plan before moving ahead with a bond measure. <br><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/School_bond_elections_in_California" style="color:#e24612">Learn more</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 class="text-align-center">Overview &amp; Background</h1><p>The Sausalito Marin City School District serves approximately 500 students and is comprised of two schools: a public K-8 school, Bayside Martin Luther King, Jr. Academy and a public K-8 charter, Willow Creek Academy. In the spring of 2016, following the release of a report by a state management assistance agency, the Marin County Office of Education hired a consultant to examine the feasibility of consolidating the Sausalito Marin City School District with the Mill Valley School District. At the same time, the Sausalito Marin City School Board has formed an ad hoc committee to explore restructuring our district. While it is unclear how the district will proceed, the goal of the Town Halls is to help the broader community better understand the opportunities and challenges facing our district.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Join the discussion!</h2>
